### DESCRIPTION :-  

  * This is the **Command line Arbitrary precision calculator** which is implemented using _C Programming language_.
  * It tries to implement some functionalities from unix based command **'bc'**.
  ---
  * Operations performed on countably infinite length numbers are as follows:-
    * Addition
    * Substraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Modulus  
    * SquareRoot
    * Trignometric Functions like Sine, Cosine, Tangent, input angle is considered in radian units
    * Length of the Number
    * exponential i.e e(x)
    * Factorial of a Number (try 3 digit numbers only) . _Try 1000! on Google calculator it says infinite :)_
  ---
  * All expressions are evaluated according to their **_precedence_**.
  * _paranthesis_ '()' can be used which is having higher precedence.  
  * All the operations performed are stored in  _history.txt_ file, for future reference
